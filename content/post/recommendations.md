These are a few of my favorite things. 

How to prioritize data projects for your organization: [https://blog.dominodatalab.com/data-science-use-cases/](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/data-science-use-cases/)

13 steps to follow for any general linear model (GLM) analysis: [http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/13-steps-regression-anova/](http://www.theanalysisfactor.com/13-steps-regression-anova/) (Although excellent advice in general, I disagree with the comment under step 5, "there really is no point in running post-hoc power analyses–it doesn’t tell you anything" --- certain types of power analysis are very useful after the fact, just not the kind that tells you how many observations to collect, *a priori* power analyses.)

Dealing with violations in the assumptions for GLM: [https://osf.io/se7vc/](https://osf.io/se7vc/)
