This website is relatively new, but I've been writing about stats and data analysis online for a while. Here are some links to explanations and tutorials I've written over the years, many of which focus on implementation in R.

My posts and tutorials on R Club: [http://blogs.uoregon.edu/rclub/author/rosem/](http://blogs.uoregon.edu/rclub/author/rosem/)

Example R code and functions in my github: [https://github.com/rosemm/rexamples](https://github.com/rosemm/rexamples)

To install my r package, use `install_github` from the `devtools` R package: 
```{r}
devtools::install_github(repo="rosemm/rexamples", subdir = "pkg")

library(rexamples) # to load the package
```

I'm available to help you with R code live by the minute via hackhands: [https://hackhands.com/rosemm/](https://hackhands.com/rosemm/) The first five minutes are free, so give it a try! :)
